## VSCode Intellisense Fixes

When using VSCode to edit this project, you may find the custom ROS2 messages have no types. A solution to this problem is to source the install file and then open VSC via the console.

```shell
# This is taking place from the root of the project (MRDC22) NOT (MRDC/mrdc_ws)
# If you have not built before, run the building step above

source mrdc_ws/install/setup.sh
code .
```
